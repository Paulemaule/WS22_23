Examples where floating point operations mattered:
- Vancouver Stockexchange:
    5.48 -> 5.50 or 5.45
    in Stockexchange the precision matters -> Stockexchange lost loads of money

- Patriot defense system:
    Missile with 1/10 sec time precision
    1/10 -binary-> 0.0001100110011.....
    Missile was off by 0.5 miles....

- Arianna 5:
    Rocket accumulated mistakes -> crached

- German election:
    Green party had 5% -> got into parliament :)
    Turned out to be a rounding error -> Green not in parliament :(
